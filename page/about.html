		<h2>I like making stuff.</h2>
		<div>
				I first learned to program in 5th grade. In high school, I saved up enough to build my first computer and have never looked back. I have been using the Internet since before there was even a World Wide Web because I see it as the single most democratizing and liberating force ever created. Whether it is creating websites, collaborating on music, or checking out the latest technologies, it is all driven by my passion to make stuff that empowers others to do stuff.

		<h2>I like developing for the front end of the web.</h2>
		<div>
			When I first got into front-end web development, Javascript was the thing to know. It still is, yet I had no idea that it would become such an exciting area to work in. It has come a long way since AJAX was the next big thing. Now Javascript has escaped from the browser, running on the server with technologies such as NodeJS, powering mobile apps on our phones, or even powering cross-platform desktop applications.

			Where does all this leave a front-end developer such as myself? In a very nice place! Some of our greatest minds have extended the capabilities of the language beyond all rekoning. JIT compilers have become blazing fast. Integrated technologies such as RequireJS and ECMA6 have expanded the landscape, making my work more interesting and less mundane. These changes have empowered me move beyond simply making websites work on different browsers. I wonder what I should develop next?

		<h2>I like cats and dogs.</h2>
		<div>
			Some people like dogs. Other people like cats. I like both. I also like collaborating with other professionals, whether they like animals or not. It is exciting to work on a project bigger than anything I could do by myself. That means being able to communicate in a clear and articulate manner with people who are not just programmers, but come from different backgrounds with different skill sets. At the end of the day, I like working with people who know how to count their kittens before the dogs come home to roost. Or something like that. :)
